          <h2>Brief History</h2>
          <p>
            Lego, which is a plastic brick-building toy, was created by Ole Kirk
            Christiansen in his hometown Billund, Denmark. He initially created
            wooden toys back in 1932 and named his company LEGO, from the Danish
            phrase Leg godt which meant "play well". In 1949, Lego introduced
            its first plastic brick, which was later patented in 1958 by his
            son. This interlocking brick design quickly gained popularity
            throughout Europe, leading to the opening of the first LegoLand park
            in 1968. Over the years, Lego released lines like DUPLO,
            Minifigures, and the MINDSTORMS robotics kit in 1998.
